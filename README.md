# CAGEChat Project

Welcome to my CAGEChat Project! 

This is a basic project which objective is to build a RAG System for public affais for the Contadorria e Auditoria Geral do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (CAGE-RS). 

The repo contains two parts of the project: 

## Backend 

This is the main focus on this project, where I try to mimic the ChatTCU project with open-sources libraries in Python. It contains README explaining its architecture and its API endpoints. 


## Frontend

I assume I hate this part. I'm very bad frontend designer and I keep struggling. 
However, to this project, the frontend should be a simple Streamlit prototype for testing the backend, where users can test and evaluate the project. Later I will work on this.


## Contributors

Although this is a project for studying, my objective is to improve this for a future MVP test. To accomplish this, I really need help to improve too many areas. 

Please feel free to contribute to this!
